= IP Version 6 Address

Just an idea.

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291[IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture]
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5952[A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation]
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4038[Application Aspects of IPv6 Transition]

== Status

It's just a Proof Of Concept

== Requirements

JDK17+

== Examples

[source,java]
----
var ip6Address = IPv6Address.from("FF01::101");
var loopback = IPv6Address.from("::1");
----
The loopback can be done simpler like:
[source,java]
----
var loopback = IPv6Address.LOOPBACK;
----
There are also others like:
[source,java]
----
var unspecified_one = IPv6Address.UNSPECIFIED;
var unspecified_two = IPv6Address.from("::");
----

[source,java]
----
var first = IPv6Address.from("2001:DB8:0:0:8:800:200C:417A");
var second = IPv6Address.from("2001:DB8::8:800:200C:417A");

assertThat(first.equals(second)).isTrue();
----
